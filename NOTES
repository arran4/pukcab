Improve ping command when checking SSH connections:
 * remote execute /bin/true
 * remote execute pukcab version

encrypt vault files
 * store keys in catalog

new commands:
 * `auto`: connect to server and wait for orders
 * `analysis`
   - show big files in a backup set
   - show big directories in a backup set
   - show often changing files in a backup

investigate DAR format for `archive` command (cf. http://dar.linux.free.fr/)

detect sparse files (esp. /var/log/lastlog)

better handle changing files ("Could not backup  /var/log/messages : 41070  bytes expected but  0  bytes written")

Windows
 * investigate if a Windows version would make any sense
 * use VSS (cf. vssadmin https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754968.aspx)

`web` command
 * allow FTP access
 * username/password

improve `restore` command usability
 * pukcab restore ./local-file
 * pukcab restore --in-place /absolute/path

`newbackup` command
 * refuse new backups within a 12-hour window (what about initial backups?)
