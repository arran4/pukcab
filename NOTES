encrypt vault files

new commands:

investigate DAR format for `archive` command (cf. http://dar.linux.free.fr/)

detect sparse files (esp. /var/log/lastlog)

better handle changing files ("Could not backup  /var/log/messages : 41070  bytes expected but  0  bytes written")

add a new command: analysis
 * show big files in a backup set
 * show big directories in a backup set
 * show often changing files in a backup

Windows
